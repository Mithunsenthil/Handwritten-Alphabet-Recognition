# Handwritten Alphabet Recognition System

This project implements a Handwritten Alphabet Recognition System using machine learning techniques. The system is built in Python using the Keras library and is trained on the **MNIST dataset** (a dataset of handwritten digits and alphabets). The goal is to recognize and predict handwritten characters with high accuracy.

## Introduction

Handwritten recognition is a popular problem in the field of machine learning. This project focuses on developing a neural network-based solution to recognize handwritten alphabets using the Keras deep learning library. The model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, which contains a large set of labeled handwritten characters.

## Features

- **Handwriting Recognition:** The system allows users to write on a file, and the system will recognize and predict the handwritten alphabets.
- **Keras Library:** Keras, a powerful deep learning library, is used to implement and train the neural network model.
